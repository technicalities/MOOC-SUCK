# MOOC-SUCK

List of the grand hobbyists, polymaths and autodidacts of the past and present internet. MOOCs are shallow; these people are deep. A course of [Greats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literae_Humaniores) for modern, [third-culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Culture) intellectuals. 

**Criteria**: each of the following displays a mixture of self-directed technical research and personal polemic. Each betrays an entire worldview; no single-topic [blogs](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) [however](http://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.co.uk/) [wonderful](https://www.schneier.com/). Each of the following writers would be doing exactly what they're even if not employed as an academic, or in industry.
