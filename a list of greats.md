# MOOC-SUCK

List of grand hobbyists, polymaths and autodidacts of the past and present internet. MOOCs are shallow; these people are deep. A course of [Greats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literae_Humaniores) for the modern, [third-culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Culture) intellectual. Independent of institutions.

**Criteria**: each of the following displays a mixture of self-directed technical research and personal polemic. Each betrays an entire worldview; no single-topic [blogs](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) [however](http://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.co.uk/) [wonderful](). Each would be doing exactly this even if not employed as academic or in industry.
